# Professional Certification System

A comprehensive blockchain-based certification management system built on Stacks using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

This system provides a complete solution for managing professional certifications, from exam administration to certificate renewal and continuing education tracking.

## System Architecture

The system consists of five interconnected smart contracts:

### 1. Exam Administration Contract (`exam-admin.clar`)
- Manages certification test delivery
- Handles exam scheduling and registration
- Tracks exam attempts and completion status
- Validates exam prerequisites

### 2. Score Verification Contract (`score-verification.clar`)
- Validates test results and passing status
- Implements secure scoring algorithms
- Manages grade thresholds and passing criteria
- Provides score authentication

### 3. Certificate Issuance Contract (`certificate-issuance.clar`)
- Creates tamper-proof professional credentials
- Generates unique certificate IDs
- Manages certificate metadata and validity
- Handles certificate revocation if needed

### 4. Renewal Tracking Contract (`renewal-tracking.clar`)
- Manages certification expiration dates
- Tracks renewal requirements and deadlines
- Handles renewal fee processing
- Maintains certification status history

### 5. Continuing Education Contract (`continuing-education.clar`)
- Tracks required professional development hours
- Validates continuing education credits
- Manages approved education providers
- Links CE completion to renewal eligibility
